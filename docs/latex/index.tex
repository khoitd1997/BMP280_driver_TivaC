Library used for interacting the bmp280 with tivaC tm4c123gh6pm processor, the dev board used is the TivaC line of Texas Instrument

The bmp280 board used is from Adafruit\+: \href{https://www.adafruit.com/product/2651}{\tt https\+://www.\+adafruit.\+com/product/2651}

Some A\+PI for compensating and collecting raw data was borrowed from Bosch\+: \href{https://github.com/BoschSensortec/BMP280_driver}{\tt https\+://github.\+com/\+Bosch\+Sensortec/\+B\+M\+P280\+\_\+driver}

The project was developed using Segger Embedded Studio but you should be able to use other I\+DE or build system with it

\subsection*{Features}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Read and calculate compensated temperature and pressure data
\item Read and write settings
\item Read the status of the sensor
\item Create manufacturer-\/defined settings or custom settings
\item Available in both I2C and S\+PI
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Dependencies}

The dependency is in the form of the git submodules of one of my other repo, just initialize and pull that sub module and you should be good, you can also write your own

\subsection*{Folder structure}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item src/\+: driver .c files in here
\item include/\+: .h file here
\item external/\+: Dependencies go here, for example git submodules are here
\item docs/\+: doxygen generated docs
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Code structure}

The code is divided into many layers\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item B\+M\+P280\+\_\+\+Drv files\+: the front layers, their actions are B\+M\+P280 specifc but doesn\textquotesingle{}t deal directly with S\+PI or I2C and thus agnostic to the protocol
\item B\+M\+P280\+\_\+\+Ware files\+: contain A\+PI derived from Bosch source code
\item B\+M\+P280\+\_\+\+Utils\+: contain utilities functions for B\+M\+P280\+\_\+\+Drv as well as dealing directly with the I2C and S\+PI, this is the glue layer between B\+M\+P280\+\_\+\+Drv and low layer communication functions
\item Tiva\+C\+\_\+\+S\+PI related files\+: Contain S\+PI functions for S\+P\+I0 modules of TivaC, the code is hardocded to use module 0, the CS pin hardcoded to be pin 3 of port A on the TivaC board
\item Tiva\+C\+\_\+\+I2C related files\+: Contain TivaC functions and their utilities funcs to work with I2\+C0 modules of TivaC, hard coded to use I2\+C0
